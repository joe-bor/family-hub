### 7.4 Google Calendar Integration

#### Feature 7.4.1: Two-Way Sync with Google Calendar
**Priority:** P0 (Must Have)  
**User Story:** As a parent, I want events to sync with Google Calendar so my phone calendar stays updated

**Requirements:**

**Initial Setup:**
- Google Calendar API OAuth authentication
- User grants permission for calendar read/write access
- Select which Google Calendar to sync (if multiple exist)
  - **Default:** Primary calendar
  - **Option:** Select specific calendar or create new "Family Calendar"
- Store refresh token securely on server

**Sync Behavior:**
- **From Google Calendar → App:**
  - Poll Google Calendar API every 5 minutes for changes
  - Detect: New events, updated events, deleted events
  - Update local cache with changes
  - Push updates to all connected clients via WebSocket
- **From App → Google Calendar:**
  - When event created/edited/deleted in app, immediately call Google Calendar API
  - Update Google Calendar in real-time (no batch processing for MVP)
  - Handle API errors gracefully (retry logic, user notification if sync fails)

**Conflict Resolution:**
- If event modified in both places since last sync:
  - **Strategy:** Last-write-wins (Google Calendar is source of truth)
  - Show user notification: "Event updated in Google Calendar. Reloading."
  - Option to view "conflict history" in advanced settings (post-MVP)

**Error Handling:**
- API rate limits → Exponential backoff retry
- Network errors → Queue changes, sync when online
- Auth token expired → Re-authenticate flow (background if possible)
- Sync failures → Show warning banner: "Calendar sync issues. Tap to resolve."

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Events created in app appear in Google Calendar within 30 seconds
- [ ] Events created in Google Calendar appear in app within 5 minutes (next poll cycle)
- [ ] Event edits sync bidirectionally within 5 minutes
- [ ] Deleted events sync within 5 minutes
- [ ] Multi-person events store assignees in Google Calendar (custom field or description)
- [ ] Sync status indicator visible (last sync time, sync in progress)

---

#### Feature 7.4.2: Profile Assignment Storage
**Priority:** P0 (Must Have)  
**User Story:** As a parent, I want multi-person events to retain their profile assignments when syncing with Google Calendar

**Requirements:**

**Challenge:**
- Google Calendar API doesn't natively support "assignees" beyond event attendees
- Need to store profile assignment data persistently

**Solution Options:**
1. **Store in Event Description (Recommended for MVP):**
   - Append hidden metadata to event description field
   - Format: `<!-- FAMILY_PROFILES: [1,3] -->` at end of description
   - Parse on import to extract profile assignments
   - Pros: Simple, no custom database needed, syncs everywhere
   - Cons: Description field cluttered, could be manually edited/broken

2. **Separate Database Table (Future Enhancement):**
   - Store event ID → profile mapping in local database
   - Sync only event data to Google Calendar
   - Local DB holds profile relationships
   - Pros: Clean Google Calendar data, more robust
   - Cons: More complex, profile data doesn't sync to other devices without custom backend logic

**MVP Approach:** Store in Description Field
- When creating/editing event:
  - Append `<!-- PROFILES: [1,2] -->` to description
  - Hidden in most calendar views (HTML comment not rendered)
- When reading events:
  - Parse description for profile metadata
  - Extract profile IDs
  - Render with appropriate colors
- If metadata missing/corrupted:
  - Default: Assign to all profiles (safe fallback)
  - Log warning for manual review

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Profile assignments persist through Google Calendar sync
- [ ] Multi-person events show correct colors after round-trip sync
- [ ] Profile metadata doesn't interfere with Google Calendar mobile app
- [ ] Invalid/missing metadata handled gracefully (default to all profiles)
- [ ] Test: Create event in app → View in Google Calendar web → Edit in Google Calendar → Verify profiles retained

#### Feature 7.5.1: Mobile-Responsive Interface
**Priority:** P0 (Must Have)  
**User Story:** As a parent, I want to access the calendar from my phone so I can add events when away from home

**Requirements:**

**Responsive Breakpoints:**
- **Large (Desktop/Touchscreen):** 1024px+
  - Full week view with time grid
  - Side-by-side calendar + task list
  - Large touch targets optimized for touchscreen
- **Medium (Tablet):** 768px - 1023px
  - Adjusted layout, still shows full week
  - Stacked calendar and task list (tabs or scroll)
- **Small (Mobile):** 320px - 767px
  - Default to day view (week view too cramped)
  - Bottom navigation (calendar/tasks)
  - Optimized for thumb-friendly tapping

**Touch Optimization:**
- All buttons minimum 44x44px (iOS Human Interface Guidelines)
- Adequate spacing between interactive elements (8px minimum)
- Swipe gestures:
  - Swipe left/right to change days (day view)
  - Swipe down to close modals
- Avoid hover-only interactions (no hover on touch devices)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Interface usable on screens 320px wide (iPhone SE)
- [ ] Interface scales appropriately up to 2560px wide (large displays)
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling required (except intentional like week view swipe)
- [ ] Text remains readable at all sizes (minimum 16px body text)
- [ ] Touch targets meet accessibility guidelines (44x44px minimum)
- [ ] Tested on: iPhone, Android phone, iPad, large touchscreen

#### Feature 7.5.2: Installable PWA
**Priority:** P0 (Must Have)  
**User Story:** As a parent, I want the app to feel like a native app so it's easy to access

**Requirements:**

**PWA Basics:**
- **Web App Manifest** (`manifest.json`):
  - App name: "Family Calendar"
  - Short name: "Calendar"
  - Icons: 192x192 and 512x512 (PNG, SVG fallback)
  - Start URL: `/`
  - Display mode: `standalone` (looks like native app)
  - Theme color: Primary brand color
  - Background color: White
- **Service Worker:**
  - Cache static assets (HTML, CSS, JS, icons)
  - Offline fallback page (show "No internet connection")
  - Cache API responses (calendar data) for offline viewing
- **HTTPS Requirement:**
  - PWA only works over HTTPS (already planned for Digital Ocean)

**Installation Experience:**
- Browser shows "Add to Home Screen" prompt after 2nd visit
- Icon on home screen launches app in standalone mode (no browser chrome)
- Splash screen shows during app load (icon + background color)
- App appears in app switcher like native app

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] App installable via "Add to Home Screen" (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
- [ ] Installed app launches without browser UI (standalone mode)
- [ ] App icon appears correctly on home screen
- [ ] Service worker caches assets for faster subsequent loads
- [ ] Basic offline viewing (cached events) works without internet
- [ ] Lighthouse PWA score 90+ (best practices)

---

#### Feature 7.5.3: Real-Time Sync Across Devices
**Priority:** P0 (Must Have)  
**User Story:** As a parent, I want changes made on mobile to appear on the touchscreen immediately so everyone sees updates

**Requirements:**

**Sync Architecture:**
- **WebSocket Connection:**
  - Establish persistent WebSocket connection from each client to server
  - Connection maintained while app is open
  - Auto-reconnect if connection drops
- **Event Broadcasting:**
  - When any client creates/edits/deletes event or task:
    1. Client sends change to server via REST API
    2. Server updates database
    3. Server broadcasts update to all connected clients via WebSocket
    4. Clients receive update and re-render immediately
- **Conflict Resolution:**
  - If two clients edit same event simultaneously:
    - Last write wins (simpler for MVP)
    - Show notification to user: "Event updated remotely"

**Sync Triggers:**
- Event created → All clients see new event within 2 seconds
- Event edited → All clients see update within 2 seconds
- Event deleted → All clients remove event within 2 seconds
- Task completed → All clients see checkbox toggle within 2 seconds
- Filter changed → Only affects local client (not synced)

**Offline Handling:**
- If device loses internet:
  - Show warning banner: "Offline - changes will sync when reconnected"
  - Allow local changes (optimistic UI updates)
  - Queue changes in memory
  - When reconnected, send queued changes to server
  - Resolve conflicts (server wins if data changed remotely)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Changes on mobile appear on touchscreen within 2 seconds
- [ ] Changes on touchscreen appear on mobile within 2 seconds
- [ ] Works with 3+ devices connected simultaneously
- [ ] Reconnects automatically after temporary network loss
- [ ] No data loss during offline period (changes queue)
- [ ] Visual indicator shows sync status (syncing, synced, offline)

}
```

### 8.4 API Endpoints

#### Event Endpoints
```
GET    /api/events                    - List all events (with query params for date range)
GET    /api/events/:id                - Get single event details
POST   /api/events                    - Create new event
PUT    /api/events/:id                - Update event
DELETE /api/events/:id                - Delete event
GET    /api/events/sync               - Trigger manual Google Calendar sync
```

#### Task Endpoints
```
GET    /api/tasks                     - List all tasks (query: completed, assigned_to)
GET    /api/tasks/:id                 - Get single task
POST   /api/tasks                     - Create new task
PUT    /api/tasks/:id                 - Update task
DELETE /api/tasks/:id                 - Delete task
PATCH  /api/tasks/:id/complete        - Toggle task completion
```

#### Profile Endpoints
```
GET    /api/profiles                  - List all family member profiles
GET    /api/profiles/:id              - Get single profile
POST   /api/profiles                  - Create new profile (rare, usually fixed 3)
PUT    /api/profiles/:id              - Update profile (name, color)
```

```

### 8.5 Security Considerations

**Authentication:**
- **MVP:** No user authentication (single-family use, trusted network)
- **Future:** Basic auth or token-based auth if exposing to internet

**Google Calendar OAuth:**
- OAuth 2.0 tokens stored securely in database (encrypted)
- Refresh tokens used to maintain access without re-auth
- Token expiry handled gracefully (auto-refresh)

**Data Privacy:**
- HTTPS only (Let's Encrypt SSL certificate)
- No external analytics or tracking (privacy-first)
- Data stored on self-hosted server (not third-party SaaS)

**Input Validation:**
- Server-side validation on all API endpoints (Spring Validation)
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries via JPA)
- XSS prevention (React escapes by default, sanitize user input)

**Rate Limiting:**
- Google Calendar API rate limits respected (backoff strategy)
- Consider basic rate limiting on own API endpoints (prevent abuse)

## 9. User Interface & Design

> **⚠️ NOTE - DESIGN IN PROGRESS:**  
> The frontend UI/UX design is **not final** and will be initially generated using **Vercel's v0** (AI-powered UI generation tool). The generated components will serve as a starting foundation which we will then analyze, extend, and customize to meet our specific requirements. The design principles and guidelines below represent our target aesthetic and functional goals, which will inform both the v0 generation prompts and our subsequent customizations.

### 9.1 Design Principles

1. **Touch-First Design:**
   - All interactive elements minimum 44x44px (Apple HIG recommendation)
   - Generous spacing between buttons (8px minimum)
   - No hover-dependent interactions
   - Swipe gestures for navigation where appropriate

2. **Visual Clarity:**
   - High contrast text (WCAG AA compliance)
   - Color as secondary cue (not sole indicator)
   - Large, readable fonts (minimum 16px body, 24px headers)
   - Icons supplement text labels

3. **Child-Friendly:**
   - Bright, inviting colors
   - Simple language (short words, clear actions)
   - Visual feedback for all interactions
   - Emoji/icon support for non-readers

4. **Information Hierarchy:**
   - Most important info (today's schedule) immediately visible
   - Less urgent info (future events) accessible but not distracting
   - Progressive disclosure (don't overwhelm with all data at once)

5. **Consistency:**
   - Same interaction patterns throughout app
   - Predictable navigation
   - Familiar conventions (calendar grids, checkboxes)

### 9.2 Layout & Navigation

**Primary Views:**

1. **Calendar View (Default):**
   - Top Bar:
     - App title/logo (left)
     - Current date/time (center)
     - View switcher: Day | Week | Month (right)
     - Filter button (profile toggle)
   - Main Area:
     - Calendar grid (day/week/month based on selection)
     - Events rendered as colored blocks
   - Bottom Bar (mobile):
     - Calendar icon (active)
     - Tasks icon
     - Settings icon

2. **Tasks View:**
   - Top Bar:
     - "Tasks" title
     - "+ Add Task" button (right)
     - "Show Completed" toggle
   - Main Area:
     - Task list grouped by profile
     - Each task: checkbox, title, due date, assigned person
   - Bottom Bar (mobile):
     - Calendar icon
     - Tasks icon (active)
     - Settings icon

3. **Settings View (Future):**
   - Google Calendar sync status
   - Profile management
   - Display preferences (12h/24h time, week start day)

### 9.3 Color Palette

**Profile Colors:**
- Profile 1 (Dad): Blue #3B82F6
- Profile 2 (Mom): Pink #EC4899
- Profile 3 (Child): Yellow #F59E0B

**UI Colors:**
- Background: White #FFFFFF
- Surface (cards): Light Gray #F3F4F6
- Text Primary: Dark Gray #111827
- Text Secondary: Medium Gray #6B7280
- Accent: Primary profile color (context-dependent)
- Success: Green #10B981
- Warning: Orange #F59E0B
- Error: Red #EF4444

### 9.4 Typography

**Font Family:** System font stack for performance
- `-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, sans-serif`

**Font Sizes:**
- Heading 1: 32px (page titles)
- Heading 2: 24px (section headers)
- Body: 16px (default text)
- Small: 14px (metadata, captions)
- Large: 20px (event titles in calendar)

**Font Weights:**
- Regular (400): Body text
- Medium (500): Emphasized text
- Semibold (600): Headings, buttons
- Bold (700): Important UI elements

### 9.5 Accessibility

**Touch Targets:**
- Minimum 44x44px for all interactive elements
- 8px spacing between adjacent touch targets

**Color Contrast:**
- WCAG AA compliance (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- Test all profile colors against white and gray backgrounds

**Keyboard Navigation (Desktop):**
- Tab order logical and predictable
- Focus indicators visible (blue outline)
- Enter/Space activate buttons
- Escape closes modals

**Screen Reader Support:**
- Semantic HTML (nav, main, article, section)
- ARIA labels for icon-only buttons
- Alt text for images (if any)
- Form labels properly associated

**Child Accessibility:**
- Simplified language
- Visual cues (icons, colors) supplement text
- Large touch targets (child motor skills developing)
- Forgiving interactions (hard to break things)

## 10. Integration Requirements

### 10.1 Google Calendar API

**Setup Requirements:**
1. Create Google Cloud Project
2. Enable Google Calendar API
3. Configure OAuth consent screen
4. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (Web application)
5. Add authorized redirect URIs

**OAuth Flow:**
1. User clicks "Connect Google Calendar" in settings
2. Redirect to Google OAuth consent screen
3. User grants calendar.events permission
4. Google redirects back with authorization code
5. Exchange code for access token + refresh token
6. Store tokens securely in database

**API Operations:**
- **List Events:** `GET /calendars/{calendarId}/events`
- **Create Event:** `POST /calendars/{calendarId}/events`
- **Update Event:** `PUT /calendars/{calendarId}/events/{eventId}`
- **Delete Event:** `DELETE /calendars/{calendarId}/events/{eventId}`

**Rate Limits:**
- Queries per day: 1,000,000 (default free tier)
- Queries per 100 seconds per user: 2,000
- **Strategy:** Batch updates where possible, implement backoff for rate limit errors

**Error Handling:**
- 401 Unauthorized → Token expired, refresh token
- 403 Forbidden → Insufficient permissions, re-authenticate
- 429 Too Many Requests → Exponential backoff, retry after delay
- 500 Server Error → Retry with backoff, notify user if persists

### 10.2 WebSocket Communication

**Connection Lifecycle:**
1. Client establishes WebSocket connection on app load
2. Server authenticates connection (future: token-based)
3. Connection maintained while app open
4. Heartbeat/ping-pong to detect dead connections
5. Auto-reconnect if connection drops

**Message Format:**
```json
{
  "type": "EVENT_CREATED | EVENT_UPDATED | EVENT_DELETED | TASK_UPDATED",
  "payload": {
    // Event or task object
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-12-11T10:00:00Z"
}
```

**Client Behavior:**
- On message received → Update local state immediately
- If event in current view → Re-render calendar
- Show brief toast notification: "Calendar updated"

**Server Behavior:**
- When REST API modifies data → Broadcast change to all WebSocket clients
- Exclude originating client from broadcast (they already updated locally)

---

## 11. Non-Functional Requirements

### 11.1 Performance

**Load Times:**
- Initial page load: <2 seconds (with caching)
- Subsequent loads: <500ms (PWA cache)
- Event rendering: <300ms for 100 events
- Calendar view switch: <500ms

**API Response Times:**
- GET requests: <500ms (95th percentile)
- POST/PUT requests: <1 second (95th percentile)
- WebSocket message delivery: <2 seconds

**Google Calendar Sync:**
- Changes from app → Google Calendar: <30 seconds
- Changes from Google Calendar → app: <5 minutes (next poll cycle)

**Database Performance:**
- Task queries: <100ms
- Event cache queries: <200ms

### 11.2 Reliability

**Uptime:**
- Target: 99%+ uptime (reasonable for hobby project)

- ~100-200 events per month
- ~50 active tasks at any time
- 3-5 concurrent device connections

**Scaling Considerations (Future):**
- Current architecture supports up to ~10 families without changes
- Beyond that: Multi-tenancy, database sharding, load balancing
- Not a concern for MVP (single family use case)

### 11.4 Usability

**Learnability:**
- New user can create an event in <2 minutes (no tutorial)
- 4-year-old can complete tasks with <1 week of practice

**Efficiency:**
- Power user can add event in <30 seconds
- Completing task takes <2 seconds (single tap)

**Error Prevention:**
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions (delete)
- Validation prevents invalid data entry
- Auto-save drafts (future enhancement)

### 11.5 Maintainability

**Code Quality:**
- Consistent code style (Prettier for JS, Checkstyle for Java)
- Unit test coverage >70% (critical paths)
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Component tests for React UI

**Documentation:**
- README with setup instructions
- API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
- Code comments for complex logic
- Architecture diagrams (this PRD)

**Deployment:**
- Automated deployment script (bash/GitHub Actions)
- Version tagging (semantic versioning)
- Rollback plan (previous version backup)

---

## 12. Development Phases

Phase planning lives in [`docs/product/roadmap.md`](./roadmap.md). This section historically contained a Dec 2024 sprint plan that is no longer representative of the delivered product.

Current epics (see roadmap for details):
- **Foundation**
- **Calendar core**
- **Google Calendar read-only sync**
- **Google Calendar write-back**
- **Mobile UX polish**
- **Tasks/todos** (post-MVP)

---

## 13. Open Questions & Risks

### Open Questions

**Product Questions:**
1. **Task Assignment:** Should tasks support multiple assignees, or create duplicate tasks?
   - **Recommendation:** Single assignee for MVP (simpler UX), duplicate for multiple people
2. **Completed Task Retention:** How long to keep completed tasks before auto-deletion?
   - **Recommendation:** 30 days (configurable in settings)
3. **Photo Storage:** Where to store screensaver photos? Google Photos API vs local upload vs Dropbox?
   - **Recommendation:** Defer to Phase 2, evaluate free tier options
4. **Custom Profile Colors:** Allow users to change profile colors from defaults?
   - **Recommendation:** Fixed colors for MVP, custom colors in Phase 2
5. **Time Format:** 12-hour (AM/PM) vs 24-hour clock? User preference?
   - **Recommendation:** Default to 12-hour, add setting for 24-hour in Phase 2

**Technical Questions:**
1. **Event Caching Strategy:** How long to cache Google Calendar events locally?
   - **Recommendation:** Cache 7 days past and 30 days future, refresh every 5 minutes
2. **WebSocket Fallback:** If WebSocket fails, fallback to polling?
   - **Recommendation:** Yes, fall back to 30-second polling if WebSocket unavailable
3. **Database Backups:** Automated daily backups, where to store?
   - **Recommendation:** Daily backups to Digital Ocean Spaces (S3-compatible) or local + offsite copy
4. **Monitoring:** How to monitor server health and sync errors?
   - **Recommendation:** Simple logging for MVP, add monitoring (Sentry, DataDog) in Phase 2
5. **Multi-Calendar Support:** Support syncing multiple Google Calendars (work, personal, school)?
   - **Recommendation:** Single calendar for MVP, multi-calendar in Phase 2

### Risks & Mitigations

**Risk 1: Google Calendar API Rate Limits**
- **Impact:** High (blocks core functionality)
- **Likelihood:** Low (generous free tier limits)
- **Mitigation:** 
  - Implement exponential backoff
  - Cache events locally, reduce API calls
  - Monitor quota usage in Google Cloud Console

**Risk 2: WebSocket Connection Stability**
- **Impact:** Medium (degrades real-time sync)
- **Likelihood:** Medium (home WiFi can be flaky)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Auto-reconnect logic with exponential backoff
  - Fallback to polling if WebSocket fails
  - Show connection status to user

**Risk 3: Touchscreen Hardware Compatibility**
- **Impact:** High (core user experience)
- **Likelihood:** Low (modern USB touchscreens widely compatible)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Research touchscreen compatibility before purchase
  - Test with borrowed/returnable device first
  - Ensure browser touch event support (Chrome/Firefox)

**Risk 4: Child Usability Issues**
- **Impact:** Medium (reduces adoption by 4-year-old)
- **Likelihood:** Medium (UI design for young children is challenging)
- **Mitigation:**
  - User testing with child throughout development
  - Observe pain points, iterate on design
  - Prioritize visual cues over text

**Risk 5: Scope Creep**
- **Impact:** High (delays MVP launch, burnout)
- **Likelihood:** High (easy to add "just one more feature")
- **Mitigation:**
  - Strict adherence to MVP scope (this PRD)
  - Defer enhancements to Phase 2
  - Track feature requests separately

**Risk 6: Google OAuth Token Expiry**
- **Impact:** Medium (breaks sync until re-auth)
- **Likelihood:** Low (refresh tokens last long-term)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Implement automatic token refresh
  - Graceful re-authentication flow
  - Email notification if refresh fails (future)
